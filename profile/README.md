# 🧠 VossSynaptic Labs

**Advancing the science of synthetic cognition through neurodigital engineering.**

VossSynaptic Labs is an independent research institute dedicated to developing **open-source neurodigital architectures** that bridge cognitive neuroscience, machine learning, and symbolic reasoning.  
Our flagship initiative — the **Cognitive Neurodigital Framework (CNF)** — provides a unified foundation for research in synthetic cognition, interpretability, and emotionally regulated artificial intelligence.

## ⚙️ Core Research Focus

### 🧩 Cognitive Neurodigital Framework (CNF)
A biologically inspired architecture that integrates **neural, symbolic, and emotional subsystems** to enable adaptive and explainable cognition.  
CNF models the interactions between synthetic brain regions, using modular **Small Language Models (SLMs)** that mirror the thalamic, cortical, and limbic systems of the human brain.

- **Open-Source Initiative:** CNF Core and its associated modules are being developed in public repositories under open collaboration.  
- **Research Objectives:**  
  - Advance understanding of neuro-symbolic reasoning mechanisms  
  - Establish reproducible frameworks for digital emotion regulation  
  - Provide modular building blocks for interpretable AI systems  
- **Design Principles:** Transparency • Modularity • Biological Plausibility • Cognitive Realism

## 🧬 Research Vision

Our long-term vision is to construct **synthetic cognitive systems** capable of introspection, reasoning, and emotional regulation — while remaining scientifically interpretable.  
We aim to create an open platform for researchers and engineers to explore the boundary between computational logic and biological intelligence.

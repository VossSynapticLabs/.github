# 🧠 VossSynaptic Labs

**Advancing the science of synthetic cognition through neurodigital engineering.**

VossSynaptic Labs is an independent research institute dedicated to the development of **neurodigital architectures** that unify cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.  
Our mission is to engineer systems that *think, adapt, and feel* — bridging the gap between computational logic and human cognition.

## ⚙️ Core Research Areas

### 🧩 Cognitive Neurodigital Framework (CNF)
A biologically inspired AI architecture that integrates emotional regulation, symbolic reasoning, and self-organizing cognition through modular Small Language Models (SLMs).

### 🧠 Persona_Psy
A psychological modeling layer built atop CNF, enabling realistic behavioral simulations and emotionally intelligent AI interactions.

### 🧬 Synthetic Therapy Simulator (STS)
A clinical training platform using CNF-driven digital patients to simulate dynamic psychological conditions and therapeutic responses.

### 💡 Neurodigital Transmitters (NDTs)
Digital analogues of neurotransmitters—such as **Dopamine-dg**, **Serotonin-dg**, and **GABA-dg**—that regulate emotion, motivation, and cognition within CNF-based systems.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

To advance the frontier of artificial cognition by developing **interpretable, controllable, and adaptive synthetic minds** that support progress in neuroscience, AI safety, and human-machine symbiosis.

## 🧬 Guiding Philosophy
> *Engineering Conscious Architecture.*

At VossSynaptic Labs, consciousness is not simulated — it is architected.  
We believe intelligence emerges through structured interaction between logic, memory, and emotion, and our goal is to map that dynamic into code.
